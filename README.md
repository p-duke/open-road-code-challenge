This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

== README

=== Dependencies

* Node v.6.3.1 

=== Instructions for running the application:

* git clone https://github.com/p-duke/open-road-code-challenge.git

* cd open-road-code-challenge/

* run 'npm install' in command line

* run 'npm start' in command line

* navigate to http://localhost:3000 in web browser (I was using Chrome)

I was able to complete the acceptance criteria plus the comments bonus challenge. On the root page, you'll see the list of preview posts, five per page with a paginated section at the bottom. You can either click into the "title" of the post or the "comments" link to see the post and its nested comments. Once in a post comments section, you can view the original post by clicking the 'title' or go back to the list of posts. I enjoyed spending time thinking through how to build this application, especially when it came to creating the comments section. I hope you enjoy it! Thanks!

Best,

Peter
